# B9IS123-CA

Create a class Employee, and create and test a function to compute net pay from payment, work and tax credit information.

Employee should have the following attributes:
`StaffID`, `LastName`, `FirstName`, `RegHours`, `HourlyRate`, `OTMultiple`, `TaxCredit`, `StandardBand`,

For Example:

```jg= Employee(12345,'Green','Joe', 37, 16, 1.5, 72, 710)```

Create a method computePayment in class Employee which takes HoursWorked and date as input, and returns a payment information dictionary as follows: (if jg is an Employee object for worker Joe Green)

We will assume a standard rate of 20% and a higher rate of 40%, and that PRSI at 4% is not subject to allowances. (we will ignore USC etc.)

```>>>jg.computePayment(42 '31/10/2021')```
```
{
            "name": "Joe Green",
            "Date": "31/10/2021",
            "Regular Hours Worked": 37,
            "Overtime Hours Worked": 5,
            "Regular Rate": 16,
            "Overtime Rate": 24,
            "Regular Pay": 592,
            "Overtime Pay": 120,
            "Gross Pay": 712,
            "Standard Rate Pay": 710,
            "Higher Rate Pay": 2,
            "Standard Tax": 142,
            "Higher Tax": 0.8,
            "Total Tax": 142.8,
            "Tax Credit": 72,
            "Net Tax": 70.8,
            "PRSI": 28.48,
            "Net Deductions": 99.28
        }
```
Test your class and method thoroughly, and at a minimum include test cases testing the following:

Net pay cannot exceed gross pay 
```
#TestMethod

def testNetLessEqualGross(self):
  e=Employee(#Joe Green's Information)
  pi=e.computePayment(1,'31/10/2021')
  self.assertLessEqual(pi['Net Pay'],pi['Gross Pay'])
```
Overtime pay or overtime hours cannot be negative.

Regular Hours Worked cannot exceed hours worked

Higher Tax cannot be negative.

Net Pay cannot be negative.
